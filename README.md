# CloudVandana-ASE-Coding-Assignment
I have established this repository for the coding assignment associated with the role of Associate Software Engineer (ASE) at CloudVandana. Within this repository, I have incorporated three distinct tasks encompassing Java, JavaScript, and HTML-CSS.


## JAVA
### Task-1: Create an array like (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and shuffle it.
### Task-2: Enter a Roman Number as input and convert it to an integer. (Example: IX = 9)
### Task-3: Check if the input is pangram or not. (A pangram is a sentence that contains all the alphabets from A to Z)
## JavaScript
### Task-1: Take a sentence as an input and reverse every word in that sentence. Example - This is a sunny day > shiT si a ynnus yad.
### Task-2: Perform sorting of an array in descending order.
## HTML
### Task-1: Create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the functionality of add, subtract, multiply and divide. Use the following picture for reference

### Task-2: Create a survey form with Fields; First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Country (dropdown), Gender (checkbox), Profession, email, and mobile number. All the input fields are necessary to submit the form. Create two buttons Submit and Reset. Reset will reset the form while clicking on submit, first, it will check all the fields and necessary validations and then a popup will appear displaying all the selected values with labels in front of it. On closing the popup, the form should reset all the values. Use the following image for reference
